  - Verify successful publish on npm.
- **User Action:**
  - Ensure `NPM_TOKEN` secret is correct for `@shtse8` scope.

  - Implementation of plugin options.
  - More comprehensive error handling and reporting.
  - Performance analysis and potential optimizations.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Ready for v0.1.1 Publish Attempt.
- **State:** Core functionality is working and tested. CI/CD is set up.
  Documentation added. Package name updated to `@shtse8/bun-plugin-dts` and
  version bumped to `0.1.1` to resolve previous publish error. Ready to commit
  changes and trigger the publish workflow for `v0.1.1`.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **NPM Token Permissions:** The `NPM_TOKEN` secret must be valid and have
  permission to publish packages under the `@shtse8` scope on npm.
- **Previous Failed Publish:** The `v0.1.0` tag exists but the corresponding
  publish failed. Publishing `v0.1.1` under the new name should succeed if the
  token is correct.
