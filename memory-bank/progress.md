## 2. What's Left to Build

    - Tag and push `v0.1.2` to trigger publish workflow.
    - Verify successful publish of `v0.1.2` on npm.
- **User Action:**
    - Ensure `NPM_TOKEN` secret is correct (if publishing).
- **Refinement & Features:**
    - Implementation of plugin options.
    - More comprehensive error handling and reporting.
    - Performance analysis and potential optimizations.
- **Testing:**
    - Tests covering plugin options and edge cases.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Repository Enhancements Completed.
- **State:** Core functionality working, tested, documented. CI/CD setup confirmed working. Package name corrected. README updated with support info. Funding file added. Repo metadata updated. Version bumped to `0.1.2` in `package.json` (uncommitted). Ready to commit all pending changes.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **v0.1.1 README:** The published v0.1.1 on npm might have the README reflecting the old package name. Publishing v0.1.2 will correct this.
