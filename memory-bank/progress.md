# Progress: bun-plugin-dts (Refinement & Options)

## 1. What Works

- Basic project structure initialized.
- Dependencies installed.
- Plugin boilerplate created.
- Build script configured.
- Memory Bank established and updated.
- **Core `.d.ts` generation logic implemented and tested:**
  - Accesses Bun build config (`entrypoints`, `outdir`, `root`).
  - Finds and parses project `tsconfig.json`.
  - Integrates with TypeScript Compiler API (`ts.createProgram`,
    `program.emit`).
  - Basic diagnostic reporting implemented.
  - Verified with a simple test fixture using `bun:test`.
- Test infrastructure created (`test/fixture`, `test/build.ts`,
  `test/plugin.test.ts`).
- `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` cleaned up and configured.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Refinement & Features:**
  - Implementation of plugin options (overrides for `tsconfig.json` path, output
    dir, etc.).
  - More comprehensive error handling and reporting.
  - Performance analysis and potential optimizations (if needed).
- **Testing:**
  - Tests covering plugin options.
  - Tests for edge cases (missing tsconfig, TS errors, multiple entry points).
- **Documentation & Publishing:**
  - Update `README.md` with usage and configuration.
  - Fill in remaining `package.json` details (author, repo, etc.).

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Refinement & Options Implementation.
- **State:** Core functionality is working and tested for the basic case. Ready
  to add configuration options and improve robustness.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None currently identified. Focus is now on adding features and improving
  quality.
