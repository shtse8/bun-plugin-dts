# Active Context: @shtse8/bun-plugin-dts (Ready for v0.1.1 Publish)

## 1. Current Focus

The package name has been updated to the scoped name `@shtse8/bun-plugin-dts`
and the version bumped to `0.1.1` to resolve the previous publishing conflict.
The focus is now on committing these changes and triggering the publish workflow
for the new version.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Renamed Package:** Updated `name` in `package.json` to
  `@shtse8/bun-plugin-dts`.
- **Bumped Version:** Updated `version` in `package.json` to `0.1.1`.
- Created GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`).
- Committed and pushed the workflow file to the GitHub repository.
- Updated `package.json` with GitHub repository details.
- Initialized local Git repository and pushed initial code + workflow.
- Added `README.md` and `LICENSE` files.
- Attempted to publish `v0.1.0` (failed due to 403 error, likely name conflict
  or token issue).

## 3. Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes:** Commit the `package.json` update (name and version) and
   updated Memory Bank files.
2. **Push Commit:** Push the commit to `origin master`.
3. **Tag and Push v0.1.1:** Create and push the `v0.1.1` tag to trigger the
   GitHub Actions publish workflow for the correctly named package.
4. **(User Action)** Ensure the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub is correct and has
   permissions for the `@shtse8` scope if necessary.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Scoped Package Name:** Using `@shtse8/bun-plugin-dts` avoids potential
  naming conflicts and clearly identifies the publisher.
- **Version Bump:** Incrementing to `0.1.1` provides a clean slate for
  publishing under the new name.
