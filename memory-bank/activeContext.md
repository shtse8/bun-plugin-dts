# Active Context: @shtse8/bun-plugin-dts (Metadata & Funding Updated)

## 1. Current Focus

The GitHub repository metadata (description, topics) and funding information (`funding.yml`, README support section) have been updated as requested. The next step is to commit these changes.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **GitHub Repo Updated:** Description and topics (tags) updated via `gh` CLI.
- **Funding File Created:** `.github/funding.yml` created with GitHub and Buy Me a Coffee links.
- **README Updated:** Added a "Support" section with a Buy Me a Coffee badge/link.
- **Previous:** Version bumped to `0.1.2` in `package.json` (awaiting commit).

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Commit Changes:** Commit the `funding.yml` creation, `README.md` update, and previous `package.json` version bump (`0.1.2`). Also include updated Memory Bank files in the commit.
2.  **Push Commit:** Push the commit to `origin master`.
3.  **(Optional)** Tag and Push `v0.1.2` if the intention is still to publish the version bump immediately after these changes. Confirm with user if needed.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Combining the metadata/funding updates with the previous version bump into a single commit seems reasonable unless the user prefers separate commits.
