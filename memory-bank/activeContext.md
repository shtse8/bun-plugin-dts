# Active Context: @shtse8/bun-plugin-dts (Ready for v0.1.2 Publish)

## 1. Current Focus

Version `0.1.1` was successfully published, but likely before the README update
was included in the tagged commit. The package version has been bumped to
`0.1.2` to allow publishing the latest code including the corrected README. The
focus is on committing the version bump and triggering the publish workflow for
`v0.1.2`.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Corrected README:** Updated `README.md` with the scoped package name.
- **Amended Commit:** Added README fix to the commit for `v0.1.1`.
- **Force-Pushed Commit:** Updated `master` branch on GitHub.
- **Re-tagged v0.1.1:** Deleted and re-pushed the `v0.1.1` tag pointing to the
  amended commit.
- **Second Publish Attempt Failed:** The workflow triggered by the re-pushed
  `v0.1.1` tag failed because that version was already published by the _first_
  push of the tag.
- **Bumped Version:** Updated `version` in `package.json` to `0.1.2`.
- Renamed Package to `@shtse8/bun-plugin-dts`.

## 3. Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes:** Commit the `package.json` version bump (`0.1.2`) and
   updated Memory Bank files.
2. **Push Commit:** Push the commit to `origin master`.
3. **Tag and Push v0.1.2:** Create and push the `v0.1.2` tag to trigger the
   GitHub Actions publish workflow.
4. **(User Action)** Monitor the workflow for `v0.1.2` on GitHub Actions.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Version Bump:** Incrementing to `0.1.2` is necessary because `0.1.1` is
  already published on npm.
